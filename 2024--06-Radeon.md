AMD just announced the Radeon W7900, a PCIe GPU/AI card: at 295 Watts, AMD claims a bit over 60 TFLOPS of FP32[^anand].

That's roughly comparable to the raw compute of NASA's Columbia supercomputer from 2004[^1],[^ram].

This cluster joined 20 Silicon Graphics Altix computers into a single machine; software running on the cluster saw a single computer with 10,240 CPUs.

In two decades, we've gone from a multi-million dollar bespoke data center experiment, about the size and power consumption of a (small) supermarket, to a retail part about the size of your shoe[^0].


What does that say about Moore's Law?

In this case, the numbers line up nicely, if we stick to approximations of one significant digit[^2].

One processor that can do a job that required ten thousand, twenty years ago.

Figuring out the doubling rate, the number of times we multiply by two, is $\frac{20}{\log_2 10,000}$.

Base-two logarithms can be particularly familiar for those accustomed to binary arithmetic. How many bits do we need to represent the number 10,000? Thirteen bits is 8192, double again for fourteen bits at 16384.

Somewhere between 13 and 14 doublings, then. (Calculator says $13 \frac{1}{3}$.) 20 years is effectively 1.5 years to double the amount of compute.

It seems that in this case, Moore's Law is doing fine[^ram].

[^2]: After all, that's what Moore's Law is all about: an approximation, a tool to think about the exponential explosion of computing capability, keeping to maths that fit on a bar napkin.


[^0]: We're ignoring the CPUs of the host workstation for the Radeon W7900 for this comparison.

[^ram]: The RAM of the Columbia computer crushes any workstation built in 2024: 20 terabytes. That's a completely different level of the kinds of problems this machine could solve. The Radeon W7900 packs 48GB of HBM RAM.
