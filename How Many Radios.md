At the Apple World Wide Developer Conference during the summer following Steve Jobs' announcement of the iPhone, the excitement was palpable. People were keyed up. Everyone knew that the world had changed fundamentally, but there were still no iPhones available to the general public. There were no iPhones available to general developers, either.

The world had changed, but no one knew how. What shape the  new world would be when it arrived. And two days in, we still didn't know... Which led us to believe that as far as Apple had planned for a developer community for the iPhone, the plan was that there was no developer community for the iPhone. It didn't exist yet. At most, Apple might seemed to have expected the phone's capabilities to suggest new web services. A web site with some nice design for the small screen, done in an afternoon. Boom! Sweet!


Generally, for lunch, you had arranged meetings yourself, or you rattled around in the cavern of Moscone West and settled at a table and met some people new to you. Cold macaroni salad and crusty sourdough bread... I found myself at a table with an electrical engineer who specialized in the tiny, low power radios used in cell phones. Remarkably, after a time at Apple on some radio engineering, he was moving back to Motorola.

"You see this thing here?" he said, holding  up his Motorola cell phone. "There's ten different radios in there! And it's just your basic cell phone now..."

It wasn't what you would call a "smartphone" -- this was June in 2007. It was a GSM, GPRS (cellular voice and data modem) with a GPS module (before Baidu or Galileo were in operation; GLONASS support was up there but not commonly available). It had a Bluetooth module for short-distance connections, generally to your car audio and maybe to exchange address book entries with another device.

His claim, as seasoned radio telecommunications professional, was that there was no way that Apple was going to be able to keep up with constant competition in the cellular business. Ten radios! Even assuming this first iPhone worked as promised (it also had Wifi!), it was going to take years to come up with the next model. Supporting global carriers was going to bog them down in conflicting requirements and regulations...

Yeah.

Well, Apple went with AT&T, as they were America's leading GSM network operator. And GSM, with few variations, could support the standard European networks with the same radios.


But an interesting question:

I'm writing this on a 2020 model, iPhone SE.

How many radios?




We had no doubt that major players like Microsoft or Google had some team working with the things (although now indeed I do have doubts). Major wireless vendors had test units. No one knew how that was going to turn out in the short term. In the USA, in exchange for taking a risk at dedicating major engineering resources and an untested business model to an absolute newcomer to mobile telephony, AT&T had a two year exclusive right to sell and support the iPhone.
