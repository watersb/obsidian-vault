My daughter has:
  * been fully vaccinated
  * was attending a college class on campus
  * tested positive for COVID

It’s not over.


Mild so far.

Don’t know exactly where she caught it. Probably multiple factors at play here…

She contacted professors, who told her that they had been told that classmates in her PUBLIC HEALTH CLASS were unvaccinated. They don’t know who.

As I see more stories, and hear from more friends and parents, I hear the outrage… and believe that unvaccinated status anonymous might be the right approach if there is a solid contact tracing system in place at another level.

So classmates and professors can’t tell parents of other students. But university health services knows who to call immediately.

Fewer pitchforks, more vaccinations. Please. Right now.
But delays will kill people.
