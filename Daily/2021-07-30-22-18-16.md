Creating a new note had to be very fast. There must be a way to do this with one gesture on mobile. I haven't found it quite yet.

[[Damn You Autocorrect]] is the proper nomenclature.

Maybe the best way to create new notes is to simply refer to one that doesn't exist yet. When I want to expand on that idea a bit, I just click on the dead link. Let's see what happens...
