I am editing this entry from my Kindle Fire HD. It's a great little device that I bought new for $100.

Setting up the GitJournal repository was once again a royal pain in the confused ass. From GitJournal, I could check out the repo, no problem, totally as expected. I could set it up to "store externally". The files showed up in the GitJournal app just fine. *And no files to be seen, in the Android Files app. Or Termux. Or Obsidian.*

I decided it would be a good time to clean up residue files from the Kindle tablet. I deleted anything in the top level folder that looked like it was not needed: empty folders, folders and files that seemed to be left over from apps no longer installed, etc... I can't recommend this as a lifestyle choice, but I figured it wouldn't brick the device. So yeah. Lots of stuff deleted.

From there I would clear storage for the GitJournal app. Didn't seem to matter. Uninstalled Obsidian and GitJournal apps, deleted all the data, reinstalled. Reset the settings for GitJournal "external repo" option.

Eventually, I was able to get the files to appear in the Android Files app. Termux and Obsidian "open folder as vault" are all working now.

I have no idea what the hell happened.
