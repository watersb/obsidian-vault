title: Dream

I was sent to monitor the third kingdom, a warlike kingdom of terrifying power. In the course of escape, there were large fields in that utterly mechanized society that had been left untouched, even as people died for lack of a place to sleep out of the harsh cold of brutal winter. These were the domains of the native life, serpent forms at least as large as a man, native superstition held that the snakes would whisper to them in their sleep. Anyone who ventured into these empty steppes would hear the voices for the rest of their lives, would go mad.

I retreated into this land out of desperation. The only native plant live above ground on these plains consisted of the prairie grasses of great variety, and a squat bush somewhat like the Terran yucca plant, topped with an immense cone like a giant fir tree. The closest thing that Anarres has to a flowering plant, the cone would give seed and then the bush would expire. The plains were littered with these dry cones some the size of an automobile, and I capped the holes of the serpent lairs with them as I fled. Once I gained altitude, an eyeblink to link once more with the net, I set the cones ablaze. Never having seen fire unchecked, many of the cones exploded with unexpected force. 

The primary holes of the native snakes collapsed, while the rest of the plains boiled with the snakes erupting onto the surface for the first time in recorded history. A seething mass of them .  In more gentle times, the serpents would whisper to the madmen of their own memory, the vast trans migration onto the plains during the passage of Anarres through the interface between the two pairs of the system's binar stars, a week of incredible upheaval in the earth, vast electrical storms, wind and rain and a sky where at least one sun burned without night for ten planetary rotations . Only then would the dream snakes breathe air on the surface. Or so the madmen believed.

Madness blossomed in that time, the whisper of serpent raised to a scream . Half the sensitives of Anarres died outright, the madmen dropped into catatonic dream, and no man alive would sleep that night, as the voices were heard by all.

Worst of it, the accordion players, the meta-lutes, the music forever changed. No one could but look at the keyboard of such instruments and not hear the wail of unearthly song.

Strong military command structure, a tradition of winning engagements, a rule of law: there was much to admire and to learn from them.

If we were very very lucky, we would each fail to conquer the other, having each discovered that within themselves that which was worth preserving.


Explosions again, as fifty percent of the constabulary collapsed into the catacombs, fifty years of tunnels the snakes had dug, unknown horror made real. 

Now the highscrapers were beginning to fall.

At the citadel, the fields held fast, space-rated tractors binding the structure even as acres of highscraper glass rained down from the sky.

The fields held. Generated gravity, inertial dampers masked the worst of the quakes, even as the ground beneath them fell into bottomless pits. Score k e for the Earth men, she thought, and staggered even as the floor held firm: You could hear the snakes scream.

And sixty percent of those blast doors remaining had stood open for so long that they rejected the command to close as invalid. The explosions tore through the compound unchecked.


The earth shook and the roar, you could hardly hear yourself think. Still she called to him: Nicket, look at me! Look at me! as he chased the shiny balloons, jumping and turning as they rose into the air. And an insane hope rose within her, something akin to despair, to love so deeply as to lose oneself completely, and Nicket would raise his face to her, sunflower to the light, with those eyes, those golden serpent eyes.

, gold and deeper than the greatest well
Bottomless 


He was once again in his own time. Or so the clock said: 8018, the third day of the month of Sarastry.

"So you're back," she said, flat voice, promising nothing. But of course there was no "back" in time. Only that River that runs forever.
