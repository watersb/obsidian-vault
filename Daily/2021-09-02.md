Getting there; I am rebasing the GitHub repo to ignore [[Obsidian]] folder ; every time I even look at the vault, on whatever platform, the obsidian folder on that device changes state. And I don't care.

There might be a problem with the way obsidian reflects these changes in its implementation -- significant config items might be mixed in there with insignificant state changes like the current window position or current open file.

The GitHub sync is really almost yet not there and I worry.

[[Obsidian]] format round trips continue to be confusing: it adds another layer of confusing on top of GitHub sync. I am using [[Working Copy for my iOS Setup]].


I misplaced some updates, and can’t find them in the commit logs.

But this might be down to me forgetting which note I was editing…
Ah! Found the changes: on my iPhone in the Working Copy app, as a [[Stash]].
