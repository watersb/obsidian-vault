Yeah, there are things that I wish would "click" for me, too. 

I have come to believe that recreational play can be a process of reinforcing the ability to acquire new skills. Or play, like dreaming, can be an unconscious way of sorting out new experiences against the frameworks you already possess.

As I wrote this, I was struck by the literal sense of the Engligh word: "re-creation".

My best work as a programmer has always come to me as I am walking, or in the shower as I wake up. My worst work has always been sleep-deprived nonsense.

While the BrontÃ« sisters' imaginary world may have no intrinsic value, it may well be that the experience of creating such a thing led them to success in other ways.



I hit the Calculus Wall my frehman year in college... but found an affinity for algebra. I found that the real Maths students consistently had a point of view that I have yet to acquire.

But the math I did learn, particularly basic Linear Algebra, has led me to see similar concepts in other phenomena. A framework. Combinatorics and Graph Theory helped a lot, too, even though the details are lost to me now.

And after five years of flunking Maths classes, I finally started to enjoy proofs. I seriously I am bad at Maths but find that I am grateful for some of the skills I've learned along the way.
