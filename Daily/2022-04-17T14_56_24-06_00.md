title: Where Am I?
subtitle: Is This Thing On?

I don't know where I am...

These days, we don't get lost. I have a map, a GPS in my pocket, also a compass, altimeter, step counter, and flashlight.

You don't get lost.

It's not you, it's me.

We can't get lost.

Things. Things get lost.

Ideas get lost. Lists of Action Items. Photographs: how the fuck can you lose photos these days?

And yet, they aren't there. It must have been a dream. A machine dream. Ten years ago, iCloud Java or whatever. It's there, just go get it... 2013...

It's not there. Two pictures from the kid's iPod Touch. Twenty. The photos that I took, nope. Some. There's one, there's the dogs... Where are the ones of my son on Fourth of July? I don't see...

My very old iPad-- I'm typing this on my iPad4-- can do very little these days. In dog years, this iPad is 98 years old. (On the internet, no one knows you're a dog.) It used to do more, but I received it as a (very generous) gift, and it is the base model that everyone buys. Back then, perched on the End of Mayan Time, the iPad was offered with 16 GB of storage and rich, Corinthian leather. Not RAM: 16 GB for all storage.

Sixteen gigabytes ought to be enough for anybody.

Well. It's a challenge. I have a couple of books, this text editor, Safari (horrifically obsolete) -- and a precious 1 GB of photos, apparently, that I can't see, can't delete, can't find.

Things get lost.
