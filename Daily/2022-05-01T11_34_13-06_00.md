Long complex

After the kids had gone, I went to Market.

Festival time as usual. They were all arrayed on the slowly processing trays, bilats and radials. Always reminded me of huge slabs of beef, steaks and sides from some immense animal, and the resemblance wasn't far off and yet still light years away.

They offer themselves up, to be eaten and help us grow back that which our bodies cannot learn to use up and cast aside. But we are not of Earth. And we discard that which cannot learn new ways that we have chosen. The native, the symmetric, they added us to their fold, as we grew strong on the food made so abundant. Technically, it's altruism. But of course, the great benefit to us all.

They cannot travel, they let go of such tech aeons ago, long before we arrived. And we had old bodies, starved, burnt from the radiation and centuries on ice, twisted with pain. Our crops grew, some of the self pollinating ones, huge and lush.
