My folks don't approve; they say she's just a simulation. "Nothing more than a dream," they say.

Well, Bethie ain't no dream. I mean, she is one, sometimes, but she's just as much flesh and blood as anyone. Same age as me, we been best friends since we was three years old. She has to go to school, don't she? She gets hungry and tired and ornery sometimes, and we both got bit real as real when those ants come all over, that time we stepping in that anthill.

Simulation. I paid attention to that word, after it came up when folks talked to me about it. I listened real good. Big words. I began to understand something, but I didn't think it was what they intended: the bigger the words, the farther away they are. I mean, the number of letters in a word is like a measure of the distance between what they mean and what they understand.

Emulation. That's a word, too. It's a was to make something that's complicated, out of something simple. Build up from bits that act together in simple ways, and you get a bigger thing that's more than you expect.

Only thing different about Bethie, what they mean, is how she got started.
