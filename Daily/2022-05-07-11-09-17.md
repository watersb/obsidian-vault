So last night was a complex dream and the dream had two groups of children who had never met one another I think from different sides of the major conflict of some kind of war and anti-time there was also all the adults course on either side of this big battle And we were trying to accuse maybe of course to be in fear they can't get along they were so many different groups and risk associated shown it to him so right I mean collaborating with four they get a secret for us also the way we broke it we were able to computer or some kind of transcendent intelligence conflict with subliminal type of messages in an hour of the cadence of their speech further into the kind of stories that they would tell that they would share with one another pop culture icon cartoon characters are not just something that information cooked up on the contrary had no idea

 So the ministry of information did not create these messages or these pop culture references instead it was some emergent collective consciousness that emerged from intelligence it was not conscious rather the surgeon information and databases that is not conscious not intelligence and five means of different tribes would share information amongst themselves that they would not necessarily of talk to other groups the pop culture youth culture of one planets never interacted very much at all really can you tell the same stories or have the same as the other characters or stories but so what happened is is that everybody is searching for peace for searching for solutions or wanting to be safe and so system a solution and escape advanced technique for communication and sharing for advanced technologies for literally escape rocket ships or whatever popular build are devastated ecology intentional Way by means of these new technology ways of sharing rather than dissolving into warring states attention ways of existing will never get completely passed one of the other but in this way that the ministry of information or that encryption and spooks in the Warriors we're not made aware of these things because as soon as that would perhaps tend to occur sensor clampdown antivirus so security protocols all of these only was it for humans the artificial intelligences of the respective Warren conflict parties will always be on the lookout for threat emerging you say four weeks technology secrets proprietary so what really happened is that the information weekend anyway at least you're not wave property again search popular culture perhaps of information wants to do anything that would the information always trying to be out in the world to be correlated they were the librarians people in the research industry was constantly trying to integrate collect all the information and then of course didn't have the sense of shit you know protect information the dynamic between a sort of public key cryptography a complementary pair so over decades one pop culture ended up with a side channel filled with one aspect of the information encrypted while the other had a complementary aspect we were gathered festival interplanetary you were international school and it was very weird so they started to play a piece of me music that was popular planets is very popular in this one to play this music and I was sitting in and I started along with it stabbing on a chair and desk music because it was it doing this bitch the person next to me started doing the other one but that was something I've never heard before I was like these two bits of rhythm and out that happens all the time of course all of her parents actually were also encodings access to advanced technology even the nation states were not aware of these technology stay with insights if you will get other collected in a critical mass artificial intelligence search engine and it broke through it became intentional or became aware if it came something bad because they were all the recordings of the events as Pop music and and and and story video and VR and game kids getting together expression opened up the cash treasury of more than a century of scientific and technological insight and breakthrough that artificial intelligences had created but it never been properly indexed because it was all fragmented anything that had not been like that had not been encrypted secret not secret in like and there was a big brother top-secret that way the key inside here is not that government was holding the key to all of us and simply not sharing time is that of artificial intelligences's work out how no one asked the question because they could not share the inside any keywords since it says a little bit the little encodings of an expression of these scientific breakthroughs on these technological all of those conscious and human mystic representations of these technologies has been never expressed start an espresso you know sliced and diced and put them to a certain field and you know I never is a blindness there an ontological paralysis we didn't have the words to talk about this concept because it wasn't done that way the way it was done is if the world is sliced in certain planes of inquiry analogist you're a computer program oh that's security process you should go look at security prices that's not robotics for all these fine graduations of the conceptualization of what is even possible but I've never been expressed how do you search for such a thing we've all had the experience of trying to get out something you know searching for it on the Internet and the problem might come up that I colors search shadow where the best word I can come up with a phrase I can come up with to describe what I'm trying to look for that I don't know about yet fortunately completely blitzed by saying you know a popular album with those sub term of art that it has nothing to do with what I'm talking about I'll try to come up with what's possible the cybernetics systems can't help you the integration of these of this complex data is not possible for you couldn't get your thesis advisor to sign off on your own that has happened in all the time new PhD thesis that happens all the time this is just a new way of phenomenon that happened and looked for unlocked for him ever and ever
