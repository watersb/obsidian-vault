# Touch Tone

Telephones in the United States were in most homes and place of business. Everywhere.

Telephone had a microphone and a speaker. Usually these were carbon diaphragm voice coil transducers.



that got use there required an electrical connection from one telephone to the other

Touch tone keypads used to be an extra service charge on your telephone bill.

Also, much like cable TV Internet providers today, the telephone used to be property of the telephone company; they would "rent" the device for you as a monthly fee.

Connecting your own device to their network was not only a breach of your contract with the company, it was also illegal in the United States, sort of the way that transmitting radio is subject to FCC regulation.

In practice, there were a couple of advantages to this for the customer, at least as I recall.

The phones were nearly indestructible. But when a phone stopped working properly, you called the Company and a guy (it was always a guy) would come out and replace it for you. Since they controlled the entire service chain, all the way down to interior house wiring and the telephone you were holding in your hand, anything at all wrong with the quality of service was them to chase down.

That's it. Those were the advantages.

Then, the phone system was broken up into pieces, AT&T agreed to stay out of the computer business for a while, and in an effort to appease the legislators and improve their image a bit, they licensed their operating system software to research institutions for a very small fee. The world got UNIX, the C programming language, AWK, and friends -- and lost Bell Labs.

That all came later.

The big deal that breaking up the phone system was supposed to give us was less government regulation, a market spurring healthy innovation in telecommunications, lower prices for the consumers, bigger returns for shareholders, and hagiography for the neo-conservative ideals that would crush communism and make the world safe for democracy.

We got cheap phones. And you could call long distance, all the way across the country, for a dollar for the first minute and fifty cents a minute after that. With touch tone dialing.

You could plug other things into that socket. Answering machines. Tape recorders. Computers!

We got other weird things, for as the price of phone service started to come down, the cost of computer automation was also dropping. Precipitously. So you could press '*' for more options.

TEXT MESSAGES came later.
