# Damn You Autocorrect

[[History of AutoCorrect]]. This isn't particularly news. But it's a thing, and there is perhaps a specific form of bit rot that creeps in with my usage of keyboards on touchscreens.

Without some predictive magic, mobile keyboard on modern devices would feel very wrong. Swiping or dragging across the keyboard would not work, either: the device needs to pick the best word that matches the sequence of letters roughly on the path of the swipe.
