# Essential Services for Modern Living

Trying to prioritize needs, we seem to agree on breathable air as the most immediate need. As is often the  car with all of our most fundamental requirements for survival, we take breathing for granted -- until something prevents us from doing so! A healthy human can usually hold their breath for a minute or so, and with practice can increase that to as much as four minutes, but that's quite uncomfortable and requires serious practice... But why even mention the air? It's always there, it's not a resource that can be bought out sold. But it's fire season in California once more. Last year (2020), the wildfires were so dense, so extreme, that the air of much of the state of California was a thick miasma of smoke and perhaps fog. The skies were darker than late even tide, a noonday sim trying to peek through the choking clouds. Hard to believe. It was not safe to venture outside because of the poisonous air, but indoors was hardly any better. Those better prepared may have air filters that they can use to create a bit of respite. But it's hard.

COVID-19 also served as a reminder that breathing is a vital part of moment to moment...

Air. Definitely at the top of the list.

Shelter from extreme heat or cold is probably next. You can't regulate body temperature too well after exposure to direct, fierce summer sunlight; some shade can make a dramatic difference in arid or high altitude climates. Extreme cold or wet or windy conditions also interfere with our body's ability to regulate temperature. Without shelter from extreme conditions, things can get dangerous in as little as ten minutes.

For large buildings, the engineering of proper air circulation and temperature regulation is called "HVAC". I think that means Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. Conditioning includes humidity mitigation as well as cooling.

Water - clean, drinkable water - is the next bit. A healthy person can usually go without water for a day -- but it is very difficult. Generally, we each need 3-4 liters of water each day. Sanitary sewers are also a part of this picture. What goes in must come out again! Waste products must be isolated and in sufficient quantities must be actively processed before the waste is permitted back into the general environment. In areas of low population density, it can be sufficient to dig a properly shaped, deep hole... but modern urban buildings would not be safe without flush toilets and other plumbing.
