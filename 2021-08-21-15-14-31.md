Coordinating between [[GitJournal]] and [[Obsidian]] is a bit tedious; I am still using GitJournal to see how the structure of the repository changes as I write stuff. I suppose you could say that I don't trust Obsidian quite yet, in terms of [[Data Management]]. At some point, I expect that I will converge onto a workflow that sorts this out.

So right now, [[There is a Mountain]].

A significant aspect of this writing tool is that it is fundamentally a collection of text files and associated images etc in a GitHub repository. Even the most antiquated of my gadgets can handle that. I've set up [[application authentication tokens]] that I can use for the older or less-teustworthy devices. I can basically write stuff on any of the things; I'm writing this with two thumbs on a [[Kindle Fire HD]]. I haven't yet tried to do this on our oldest iPad, but the second-oldest still does the job, even as JavaScript burden grows ever more hopeless -- editing basic stuff in a web browser might be ambitious for the old things.
