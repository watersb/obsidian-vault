Telephone keypads have been used to enter English text since the beginning of "Touch Tone" dialing.


### Fun facts
 Touch tone keypads used to be an extra service charge on your telephone bill.

Also, much like cable TV Internet providers today, the telephone used to be property of the telephone company; they would "rent" the device for you as a monthly fee.

Connecting your own device to their network was not only a breach of your contract with the company, it was also illegal in the United States, sort of the way that transmitting radio is subject to FCC regulation.

In practice, there were a couple of advantages to this for the customer, at least as I recall.

The phones were nearly indestructible. But when a phone stopped working properly, you called the Company and a guy (it was always a guy) would come out and replace it for you. Since they controlled the entire service chain, all the way down to interior house wiring and the telephone you were holding in your hand, anything at all wrong with the quality of service was them to chase down.

That's it. Those were the advantages.
